<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Abrasive Blasting Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure</li><li>Siphon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable abrasive blasting equipment market is primarily divided into two types: pressure and siphon systems. Pressure blasting operates by pressurizing the abrasive material, allowing it to flow at high velocities, resulting in a more efficient and faster cleaning or surface preparation process. In contrast, siphon blasting utilizes a suction mechanism to draw abrasive material from a hopper, making it generally more economical but slower than pressure systems. Both types cater to different applications and user preferences in surface finishing tasks.</p></p>
